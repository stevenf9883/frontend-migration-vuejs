# Assignment - Migrate legacy frontend to Vue

## Scenario

There is a legacy website written in PHP without any framework and the codes are quite messy.  
After a long deliberation, team leader decides to use __Vue__ as the frontend framework for better development experience.  

You are now an employee of the company, as a frontend engineer, your first mission is to do the code refactoring and try to migrate the existed functions written in JavaScript / jQuery to __Vue__.

## Target

1. Extract CSS and JavaScript __into external files__. You can decide folder structure to store them.
2. Migrate existed JavaScript / jQuery functions to __Vue__ with version __2.x__.
3. Use __Vue__ to perform API call in order to get movie data instead of loading local JSON file. 
   * API Endpoint - https://hw-web-api.herokuapp.com/api/movie/list.php
4. *(Optional)* Use __Vue__ to implement form validation. Make sure each textbox meet its requirement, otherwise show error message in __Red__ under it.  
   * __Title in Chinese__ - *Required*. String length must between 1 to 50.
   * __Title in English__ - *Required*. String length must between 1 to 100 and cannot include the symbols `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`.
   * __Intro__ - *Required*. String length must between 10 to 255 and need to start with `Intro`. e.g. `Intro: This is ...`, `Intro, Once upon...`.
5. *(Optional)* Use one of the frontend tools to manage static files. For example, use __Webpack__ or __Bower__ to manage __bootstrap__ and __jQuery__. Describe what tool you use and how you setup.
6. *(Optional)* Find any weakness/risk in this application, describe the weakness/risk and how you fix it.

## Deliverable

1. Upload codes to your __GitHub__ and __provide repo URL__.
2. *(Optional)* Host your codes on any cloud service, e.g. __Heroku__, __Amazon Web Serivce (AWS)__, __Microsoft Azure__, __Google Cloud Platform (GCP)__, and __provide site URL__.   
    * Here is the example on __heroku__: https://hw-frontend-migrate-vuejs.herokuapp.com/
    * If you are using __AWS__ / __Azure__ / __GCP__, describe what services you are using. 

## Notice

* Once you finished the assignment, send an email back to the one who contacted you.
* Leave comments to __README.md__ in __the root of your repo__.
* Describe details to __README.md__ if you completed __Target#4__, __Target#5__ or __Deliverable#2__.
